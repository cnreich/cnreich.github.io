        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I have a confession to make. I haven't written fiction since early last year. It was a whomping 900+ words.</p>
          <p>Has my muse abandoned me? I have more stories to tell, but I need energy to write them. Will I ever have the energy again to write again? I just don't know. I'd hate to keep these characters in my head silent. They would hate it too.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If somebody would have told me a year ago that I would be able to make a website, I would <strong>not</strong> have believed them.</p>
          <p>About a year ago, I came across Mimo and started to learn coding, including the ability to create a blog. This is not my first blog as I have been blogging off and on since 2009. Yes, folks. You read that right. <em>2009!</em> You can check out my old writer's blog by clicking <a href="https://cheriereich.blogspot.com">here</a>.</p>
